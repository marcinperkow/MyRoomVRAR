# My Room VRAR

This is my project 2 for CS 428 Virtual and Augmented Reality. In this project I created a playset of my room that has multiple elements as well as ambient sound, animation and vuforia button that changes the animation of my character smoothly. Another marker that has a real size physical desk on which I can shoot red balls and they respond to physics of the elements. I also have another scene which has a playset but in real size utilizing the ground marker.

To run the application you have to simply download and import the project into Unity3D. Once you do that go into File->Build Settings... and check your platform.
Once you do that you can build and run application by pressing Build And Run button. The application was written on Unity 2019.4.1f1 version and Vuforia 9.4.6 version.

Download this repository to try the application.
